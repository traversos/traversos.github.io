    <p>In the fall of 1927, a fifteen-year-old girl journeyed with her parents from the mountain village of Cesuna in Northern Italy to America. Lena Traverso knew no English, but her cooking sure could talk, as she had spent countless hours being raised in the kitchen of their small family hotel. The family settled on the South Side of Chicago and Lena eventually used her talents working in a number of local restaurants.</p>
    <p>When her sons opened their own restaurants in the Pullman and Mount Greenwood neighborhoods in 1962, “Mama T” came on board, bringing along her cooking talents and old-world recipes. Traverso’s opened in Orland Park, Illinois in 1974, and has since been dedicated to preserving the cooking of their native Cesuna in warm and friendly surroundings.</p>
    <p>Today, we’re happy to welcome you to the newest Traverso’s. It has long been our feeling that there are two places where you can dine in a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere – your home and ours. Welcome to ours.</p>
