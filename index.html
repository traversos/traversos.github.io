      <h2 class="push_half--bottom">To our valued customers:</h2>
      <p class="flush--bottom">
        We regret to inform that due to Covid situations among our staff, we are forced to close starting on Friday, April 16, and for the next several days, until we feel it’s safe to reopen based on testing and safety for all.<br><br>
        We hope this closure lasts no longer than 7 days, but our decisions will be driven by testing results and the insurance that our staff and customers can return to a completely safe environment.
        We will take this time to continue rigorous testing of our employees and sanitizing of our facility to reopen safely as soon as possible.

        <br><br>Thank you for your understanding,<br>Traverso’s
