      <h1>As of June 26, 2020, Traverso’s has resumed indoor dining!</h1>
      <p>
        Seating is limited by social distancing, and reservations will only be accepted for parties of five or larger.
        Per state orders, the maximum number of guests in one group is capped at 10.
        Also, all guests are required to wear masks when entering and moving about the restaurant.
        Guests are allowed to remove masks only when seated at their table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our reopening also brings a return to normal kitchen hours:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monday-Thursday, 4pm-10pm</li>
        <li>Friday-Saturday, 4pm-11pm</li>
        <li>Sunday, 12pm-9pm</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bar top seating is now open as well! (Social distancing and mask requirements still apply.)
      </p>

        Thank you to all of our customers for your overwhelming support during this crisis. We would not have survived without you.
